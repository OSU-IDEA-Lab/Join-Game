# Join-Game

<h1>Join Game Experiment</h1>
To upload the datasets that have been used for the join game experiment, you just need to run the  "data_uploader.bash" file with the 
updated database_name, username and port of your PostgreSQL database. You would also need to update the path of the file location 
that contains all the table data. The path from the data directory is present, any path that preceeds it, needs to be updated.
