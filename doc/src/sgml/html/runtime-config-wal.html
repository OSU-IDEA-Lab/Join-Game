        <code class="varname">wal_level</code> determines how much information is written to
        the WAL. The default value is <code class="literal">replica</code>, which writes enough
        data to support WAL archiving and replication, including running
        read-only queries on a standby server. <code class="literal">minimal</code> removes all
        logging except the information required to recover from a crash or
        immediate shutdown.  Finally,
        <code class="literal">logical</code> adds information necessary to support logical
        decoding.  Each level includes the information logged at all lower
        levels.  This parameter can only be set at server start.
       </p><p>
        In <code class="literal">minimal</code> level, WAL-logging of some bulk
        operations can be safely skipped, which can make those
        operations much faster (see <a class="xref" href="populate.html#POPULATE-PITR" title="14.4.7. Disable WAL Archival and Streaming Replication">Section 14.4.7</a>).
        Operations in which this optimization can be applied include:
        </p><table border="0" summary="Simple list" class="simplelist"><tr><td><code class="command">CREATE TABLE AS</code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="command">CREATE INDEX</code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="command">CLUSTER</code></td></tr><tr><td><code class="command">COPY</code> into tables that were created or truncated in the same
         transaction</td></tr></table><p>
        But minimal WAL does not contain enough information to reconstruct the
        data from a base backup and the WAL logs, so <code class="literal">replica</code> or
        higher must be used to enable WAL archiving
        (<a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-ARCHIVE-MODE">archive_mode</a>) and streaming replication.
       </p><p>
        In <code class="literal">logical</code> level, the same information is logged as
        with <code class="literal">replica</code>, plus information needed to allow
        extracting logical change sets from the WAL. Using a level of
        <code class="literal">logical</code> will increase the WAL volume, particularly if many
        tables are configured for <code class="literal">REPLICA IDENTITY FULL</code> and
        many <code class="command">UPDATE</code> and <code class="command">DELETE</code> statements are
        executed.
       </p><p>
        In releases prior to 9.6, this parameter also allowed the
        values <code class="literal">archive</code> and <code class="literal">hot_standby</code>.
        These are still accepted but mapped to <code class="literal">replica</code>.

      </span></dt><dd><p>
        If this parameter is on, the <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> server
        will try to make sure that updates are physically written to
        disk, by issuing <code class="function">fsync()</code> system calls or various
        equivalent methods (see <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-WAL-SYNC-METHOD">wal_sync_method</a>).
        This ensures that the database cluster can recover to a
        consistent state after an operating system or hardware crash.
       </p><p>
        While turning off <code class="varname">fsync</code> is often a performance
        benefit, this can result in unrecoverable data corruption in
        the event of a power failure or system crash.  Thus it
        is only advisable to turn off <code class="varname">fsync</code> if
        you can easily recreate your entire database from external
        data.
       </p><p>
        Examples of safe circumstances for turning off
        <code class="varname">fsync</code> include the initial loading of a new
        database cluster from a backup file, using a database cluster
        for processing a batch of data after which the database
        will be thrown away and recreated,
        or for a read-only database clone which
        gets recreated frequently and is not used for failover.  High
        quality hardware alone is not a sufficient justification for
        turning off <code class="varname">fsync</code>.
       </p><p>
        For reliable recovery when changing <code class="varname">fsync</code>
        off to on, it is necessary to force all modified buffers in the
        kernel to durable storage.  This can be done while the cluster
        is shutdown or while <code class="varname">fsync</code> is on by running <code class="command">initdb
        --sync-only</code>, running <code class="command">sync</code>, unmounting the
        file system, or rebooting the server.
       </p><p>
        In many situations, turning off <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-SYNCHRONOUS-COMMIT">synchronous_commit</a>
        for noncritical transactions can provide much of the potential
        performance benefit of turning off <code class="varname">fsync</code>, without
        the attendant risks of data corruption.
       </p><p>
        <code class="varname">fsync</code> can only be set in the <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code>
        file or on the server command line.
        If you turn this parameter off, also consider turning off
        <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-FULL-PAGE-WRITES">full_page_writes</a>.

        Specifies whether transaction commit will wait for WAL records
        to be written to disk before the command returns a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">success</span>”</span>
        indication to the client.  Valid values are <code class="literal">on</code>,
        <code class="literal">remote_apply</code>, <code class="literal">remote_write</code>, <code class="literal">local</code>,
        and <code class="literal">off</code>.  The default, and safe, setting
        is <code class="literal">on</code>.  When <code class="literal">off</code>, there can be a delay between
        when success is reported to the client and when the transaction is
        really guaranteed to be safe against a server crash.  (The maximum
        delay is three times <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-WAL-WRITER-DELAY">wal_writer_delay</a>.)  Unlike
        <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-FSYNC">fsync</a>, setting this parameter to <code class="literal">off</code>
        does not create any risk of database inconsistency: an operating
        system or database crash might
        result in some recent allegedly-committed transactions being lost, but
        the database state will be just the same as if those transactions had
        been aborted cleanly.  So, turning <code class="varname">synchronous_commit</code> off
        can be a useful alternative when performance is more important than
        exact certainty about the durability of a transaction.  For more
        discussion see <a class="xref" href="wal-async-commit.html" title="30.3. Asynchronous Commit">Section 30.3</a>.
       </p><p>
        If <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-SYNCHRONOUS-STANDBY-NAMES">synchronous_standby_names</a> is non-empty, this
        parameter also controls whether or not transaction commits will wait
        for their WAL records to be replicated to the standby server(s).
        When set to <code class="literal">on</code>, commits will wait until replies
        from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have received
        the commit record of the transaction and flushed it to disk.  This
        ensures the transaction will not be lost unless both the primary and
        all synchronous standbys suffer corruption of their database storage.
        When set to <code class="literal">remote_apply</code>, commits will wait until replies
        from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have received the
        commit record of the transaction and applied it, so that it has become
        visible to queries on the standby(s).
        When set to <code class="literal">remote_write</code>, commits will wait until replies
        from the current synchronous standby(s) indicate they have
        received the commit record of the transaction and written it out to
        their operating system. This setting is sufficient to
        ensure data preservation even if a standby instance of
        <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> were to crash, but not if the standby
        suffers an operating-system-level crash, since the data has not
        necessarily reached stable storage on the standby.
        Finally, the setting <code class="literal">local</code> causes commits to wait for
        local flush to disk, but not for replication.  This is not usually
        desirable when synchronous replication is in use, but is provided for
        completeness.
       </p><p>
        If <code class="varname">synchronous_standby_names</code> is empty, the settings
        <code class="literal">on</code>, <code class="literal">remote_apply</code>, <code class="literal">remote_write</code>
        and <code class="literal">local</code> all provide the same synchronization level:
        transaction commits only wait for local flush to disk.
       </p><p>
        This parameter can be changed at any time; the behavior for any
        one transaction is determined by the setting in effect when it
        commits.  It is therefore possible, and useful, to have some
        transactions commit synchronously and others asynchronously.
        For example, to make a single multistatement transaction commit
        asynchronously when the default is the opposite, issue <code class="command">SET
        LOCAL synchronous_commit TO OFF</code> within the transaction.

        Method used for forcing WAL updates out to disk.
        If <code class="varname">fsync</code> is off then this setting is irrelevant,
        since WAL file updates will not be forced out at all.
        Possible values are:

        The <code class="literal">open_</code>* options also use <code class="literal">O_DIRECT</code> if available.
        Not all of these choices are available on all platforms.
        The default is the first method in the above list that is supported
        by the platform, except that <code class="literal">fdatasync</code> is the default on
        Linux.  The default is not necessarily ideal; it might be
        necessary to change this setting or other aspects of your system
        configuration in order to create a crash-safe configuration or
        achieve optimal performance.
        These aspects are discussed in <a class="xref" href="wal-reliability.html" title="30.1. Reliability">Section 30.1</a>.
        This parameter can only be set in the <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code>
        file or on the server command line.

      <a id="id-1.6.6.8.3.2.5.1.3" class="indexterm"></a>
      </span></dt><dd><p>
        When this parameter is on, the <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> server
        writes the entire content of each disk page to WAL during the
        first modification of that page after a checkpoint.
        This is needed because
        a page write that is in process during an operating system crash might
        be only partially completed, leading to an on-disk page
        that contains a mix of old and new data.  The row-level change data
        normally stored in WAL will not be enough to completely restore
        such a page during post-crash recovery.  Storing the full page image
        guarantees that the page can be correctly restored, but at the price
        of increasing the amount of data that must be written to WAL.
        (Because WAL replay always starts from a checkpoint, it is sufficient
        to do this during the first change of each page after a checkpoint.
        Therefore, one way to reduce the cost of full-page writes is to
        increase the checkpoint interval parameters.)
       </p><p>
        Turning this parameter off speeds normal operation, but
        might lead to either unrecoverable data corruption, or silent
        data corruption, after a system failure. The risks are similar to turning off
        <code class="varname">fsync</code>, though smaller, and it should be turned off
        only based on the same circumstances recommended for that parameter.
       </p><p>
        Turning off this parameter does not affect use of
        WAL archiving for point-in-time recovery (PITR)
        (see <a class="xref" href="continuous-archiving.html" title="25.3. Continuous Archiving and Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)">Section 25.3</a>).

        When this parameter is <code class="literal">on</code>, the <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>

        non-critical modifications of so-called hint bits.
       </p><p>
        If data checksums are enabled, hint bit updates are always WAL-logged

        When this parameter is <code class="literal">on</code>, the <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>

        Turning this parameter on can reduce the WAL volume without

        The amount of shared memory used for WAL data that has not yet been
        written to disk.  The default setting of -1 selects a size equal to

        than <code class="literal">64kB</code> nor more than the size of one WAL
        segment, typically <code class="literal">16MB</code>.  This value can be set
        manually if the automatic choice is too large or too small,
        but any positive value less than <code class="literal">32kB</code> will be

        This parameter can only be set at server start.
       </p><p>
        The contents of the WAL buffers are written out to disk at every
        transaction commit, so extremely large values are unlikely to
        provide a significant benefit.  However, setting this value to at
        least a few megabytes can improve write performance on a busy
        server where many clients are committing at once.  The auto-tuning
        selected by the default setting of -1 should give reasonable
        results in most cases.

        In <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> releases prior to 9.3,
        <code class="varname">commit_delay</code> behaved differently and was much
        less effective: it affected only commits, rather than all WAL flushes,
        and waited for the entire configured delay even if the WAL flush
        was completed sooner.  Beginning in <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 9.3,
        the first process that becomes ready to flush waits for the configured
        interval, while subsequent processes wait only until the leader
        completes the flush operation.

        When <code class="varname">archive_mode</code> is enabled, completed WAL segments

        the WAL archiver is enabled also during archive recovery or standby
        mode. In <code class="literal">always</code> mode, all files restored from the archive

        The local shell command to execute to archive a completed WAL file
        segment.  Any <code class="literal">%p</code> in the string is
        replaced by the path name of the file to archive, and any
        <code class="literal">%f</code> is replaced by only the file name.
        (The path name is relative to the working directory of the server,
        i.e., the cluster's data directory.)
        Use <code class="literal">%%</code> to embed an actual <code class="literal">%</code> character in the

        exit status only if it succeeds. For more information see

        If <code class="varname">archive_command</code> is an empty string (the default) while
        <code class="varname">archive_mode</code> is enabled, WAL archiving is temporarily
        disabled, but the server continues to accumulate WAL segment files in
        the expectation that a command will soon be provided.  Setting
        <code class="varname">archive_command</code> to a command that does nothing but
        return true, e.g. <code class="literal">/bin/true</code> (<code class="literal">REM</code> on
        Windows), effectively disables
        archiving, but also breaks the chain of WAL files needed for
        archive recovery, so it should only be used in unusual circumstances.

        The <a class="xref" href="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-ARCHIVE-COMMAND">archive_command</a> is only invoked for
        completed WAL segments. Hence, if your server generates little WAL
        traffic (or has slack periods where it does so), there could be a
        long delay between the completion of a transaction and its safe
        recording in archive storage.  To limit how old unarchived
        data can be, you can set <code class="varname">archive_timeout</code> to force the
        server to switch to a new WAL segment file periodically.  When this
        parameter is greater than zero, the server will switch to a new
        segment file whenever this many seconds have elapsed since the last
        segment file switch, and there has been any database activity,
        including a single checkpoint (checkpoints are skipped if there is
        no database activity).  Note that archived files that are closed
        early due to a forced switch are still the same length as completely
        full files.  Therefore, it is unwise to use a very short
        <code class="varname">archive_timeout</code> — it will bloat your archive
        storage.  <code class="varname">archive_timeout</code> settings of a minute or so are
        usually reasonable.  You should consider using streaming replication,
        instead of archiving, if you want data to be copied off the master
        server more quickly than that.
        This parameter can only be set in the
        <code class="filename">postgresql.conf</code> file or on the server command line.
