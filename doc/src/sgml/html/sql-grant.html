</pre></div><div class="refsect1" id="SQL-GRANT-DESCRIPTION"><h2>Description</h2><p>
   The <code class="command">GRANT</code> command has two basic variants: one
   that grants privileges on a database object (table, column, view, foreign
   table, sequence, database, foreign-data wrapper, foreign server, function, procedure,
   procedural language, schema, or tablespace), and one that grants
   membership in a role.  These variants are similar in many ways, but
   they are different enough to be described separately.
  </p><div class="refsect2" id="SQL-GRANT-DESCRIPTION-OBJECTS"><h3>GRANT on Database Objects</h3><p>
   This variant of the <code class="command">GRANT</code> command gives specific
   privileges on a database object to
   one or more roles.  These privileges are added
   to those already granted, if any.
  </p><p>
   There is also an option to grant privileges on all objects of the same
   type within one or more schemas.  This functionality is currently supported
   only for tables, sequences, functions, and procedures.  <code class="literal">ALL
   TABLES</code> also affects views and foreign tables, just like the
   specific-object <code class="command">GRANT</code> command.  <code class="literal">ALL
   FUNCTIONS</code> also affects aggregate functions, but not procedures,
   again just like the specific-object <code class="command">GRANT</code> command.
  </p><p>
   The key word <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code> indicates that the
   privileges are to be granted to all roles, including those that might
   be created later.  <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code> can be thought of as an
   implicitly defined group that always includes all roles.
   Any particular role will have the sum
   of privileges granted directly to it, privileges granted to any role it
   is presently a member of, and privileges granted to
   <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code>.
  </p><p>
   If <code class="literal">WITH GRANT OPTION</code> is specified, the recipient
   of the privilege can in turn grant it to others.  Without a grant
   option, the recipient cannot do that.  Grant options cannot be granted
   to <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code>.
  </p><p>
   There is no need to grant privileges to the owner of an object
   (usually the user that created it),
   as the owner has all privileges by default.  (The owner could,
   however, choose to revoke some of their own privileges for safety.)
  </p><p>
   The right to drop an object, or to alter its definition in any way, is
   not treated as a grantable privilege; it is inherent in the owner,
   and cannot be granted or revoked.  (However, a similar effect can be
   obtained by granting or revoking membership in the role that owns
   the object; see below.)  The owner implicitly has all grant
   options for the object, too.
  </p><p>
   PostgreSQL grants default privileges on some types of objects to
   <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code>.  No privileges are granted to
   <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code> by default on
   tables,
   table columns,
   sequences,
   foreign data wrappers,
   foreign servers,
   large objects,
   schemas,
   or tablespaces.
   For other types of objects, the default privileges
   granted to <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code> are as follows:
   <code class="literal">CONNECT</code> and <code class="literal">TEMPORARY</code> (create
   temporary tables) privileges for databases;
   <code class="literal">EXECUTE</code> privilege for functions and procedures; and
   <code class="literal">USAGE</code> privilege for languages and data types
   (including domains).
   The object owner can, of course, <code class="command">REVOKE</code>
   both default and  expressly granted privileges. (For maximum
   security, issue the <code class="command">REVOKE</code> in the same transaction that
   creates the object; then there is no window in which another user
   can use the object.)
   Also, these initial default privilege settings can be changed using the
   <a class="xref" href="sql-alterdefaultprivileges.html" title="ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES"><span class="refentrytitle">ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES</span></a>
   command.
  </p><p>
   The possible privileges are:

   </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">SELECT</code></span></dt><dd><p>
       Allows <a class="xref" href="sql-select.html" title="SELECT"><span class="refentrytitle">SELECT</span></a> from
       any column, or the specific columns listed, of the specified table,
       view, or sequence.
       Also allows the use of
       <a class="xref" href="sql-copy.html" title="COPY"><span class="refentrytitle">COPY</span></a> TO.
       This privilege is also needed to reference existing column values in
       <a class="xref" href="sql-update.html" title="UPDATE"><span class="refentrytitle">UPDATE</span></a> or
       <a class="xref" href="sql-delete.html" title="DELETE"><span class="refentrytitle">DELETE</span></a>.
       For sequences, this privilege also allows the use of the
       <code class="function">currval</code> function.
       For large objects, this privilege allows the object to be read.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">INSERT</code></span></dt><dd><p>
       Allows <a class="xref" href="sql-insert.html" title="INSERT"><span class="refentrytitle">INSERT</span></a> of a new
       row into the specified table.  If specific columns are listed,
       only those columns may be assigned to in the <code class="command">INSERT</code>
       command (other columns will therefore receive default values).
       Also allows <a class="xref" href="sql-copy.html" title="COPY"><span class="refentrytitle">COPY</span></a> FROM.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">UPDATE</code></span></dt><dd><p>
       Allows <a class="xref" href="sql-update.html" title="UPDATE"><span class="refentrytitle">UPDATE</span></a> of any
       column, or the specific columns listed, of the specified table.
       (In practice, any nontrivial <code class="command">UPDATE</code> command will require
       <code class="literal">SELECT</code> privilege as well, since it must reference table
       columns to determine which rows to update, and/or to compute new
       values for columns.)
       <code class="literal">SELECT ... FOR UPDATE</code>
       and <code class="literal">SELECT ... FOR SHARE</code>
       also require this privilege on at least one column, in addition to the
       <code class="literal">SELECT</code> privilege.  For sequences, this
       privilege allows the use of the <code class="function">nextval</code> and
       <code class="function">setval</code> functions.
       For large objects, this privilege allows writing or truncating the
       object.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">DELETE</code></span></dt><dd><p>
       Allows <a class="xref" href="sql-delete.html" title="DELETE"><span class="refentrytitle">DELETE</span></a> of a row
       from the specified table.
       (In practice, any nontrivial <code class="command">DELETE</code> command will require
       <code class="literal">SELECT</code> privilege as well, since it must reference table
       columns to determine which rows to delete.)
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">TRUNCATE</code></span></dt><dd><p>
       Allows <a class="xref" href="sql-truncate.html" title="TRUNCATE"><span class="refentrytitle">TRUNCATE</span></a> on
       the specified table.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">REFERENCES</code></span></dt><dd><p>
       Allows creation of a foreign key constraint referencing the specified
       table, or specified column(s) of the table.  (See the
       <a class="xref" href="sql-createtable.html" title="CREATE TABLE"><span class="refentrytitle">CREATE TABLE</span></a> statement.)
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">TRIGGER</code></span></dt><dd><p>
       Allows the creation of a trigger on the specified table.  (See the
       <a class="xref" href="sql-createtrigger.html" title="CREATE TRIGGER"><span class="refentrytitle">CREATE TRIGGER</span></a> statement.)
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">CREATE</code></span></dt><dd><p>
       For databases, allows new schemas and publications to be created within the database.
      </p><p>
       For schemas, allows new objects to be created within the schema.
       To rename an existing object, you must own the object <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span>
       have this privilege for the containing schema.
      </p><p>
       For tablespaces, allows tables, indexes, and temporary files to be
       created within the tablespace, and allows databases to be created that
       have the tablespace as their default tablespace.  (Note that revoking
       this privilege will not alter the placement of existing objects.)
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">CONNECT</code></span></dt><dd><p>
       Allows the user to connect to the specified database.  This
       privilege is checked at connection startup (in addition to checking
       any restrictions imposed by <code class="filename">pg_hba.conf</code>).
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">TEMPORARY</code><br /></span><span class="term"><code class="literal">TEMP</code></span></dt><dd><p>
       Allows temporary tables to be created while using the specified database.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">EXECUTE</code></span></dt><dd><p>
       Allows the use of the specified function or procedure and the use of
       any operators that are implemented on top of the function.  This is the
       only type of privilege that is applicable to functions and procedures.
       The <code class="literal">FUNCTION</code> syntax also works for aggregate
       functions.  Alternatively, use <code class="literal">ROUTINE</code> to refer to a function,
       aggregate function, or procedure regardless of what it is.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">USAGE</code></span></dt><dd><p>
       For procedural languages, allows the use of the specified language for
       the creation of functions in that language.  This is the only type
       of privilege that is applicable to procedural languages.
      </p><p>
       For schemas, allows access to objects contained in the specified
       schema (assuming that the objects' own privilege requirements are
       also met).  Essentially this allows the grantee to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">look up</span>”</span>
       objects within the schema.  Without this permission, it is still
       possible to see the object names, e.g. by querying the system tables.
       Also, after revoking this permission, existing backends might have
       statements that have previously performed this lookup, so this is not
       a completely secure way to prevent object access.
      </p><p>
       For sequences, this privilege allows the use of the
       <code class="function">currval</code> and <code class="function">nextval</code> functions.
      </p><p>
       For types and domains, this privilege allows the use of the type or
       domain in the creation of tables, functions, and other schema objects.
       (Note that it does not control general <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">usage</span>”</span> of the type,
       such as values of the type appearing in queries.  It only prevents
       objects from being created that depend on the type.  The main purpose of
       the privilege is controlling which users create dependencies on a type,
       which could prevent the owner from changing the type later.)
      </p><p>
       For foreign-data wrappers, this privilege allows creation of
       new servers using the foreign-data wrapper.
      </p><p>
       For servers, this privilege allows creation of foreign tables using
       the server.  Grantees may also create, alter, or drop their own
       user mappings associated with that server.
      </p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">ALL PRIVILEGES</code></span></dt><dd><p>
       Grant all of the available privileges at once.
       The <code class="literal">PRIVILEGES</code> key word is optional in
       <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, though it is required by
       strict SQL.
      </p></dd></dl></div><p>

   The privileges required by other commands are listed on the
   reference page of the respective command.
  </p></div><div class="refsect2" id="SQL-GRANT-DESCRIPTION-ROLES"><h3>GRANT on Roles</h3><p>
   This variant of the <code class="command">GRANT</code> command grants membership
   in a role to one or more other roles.  Membership in a role is significant
   because it conveys the privileges granted to a role to each of its
   members.
  </p><p>
   If <code class="literal">WITH ADMIN OPTION</code> is specified, the member can
   in turn grant membership in the role to others, and revoke membership
   in the role as well.  Without the admin option, ordinary users cannot
   do that.  A role is not considered to hold <code class="literal">WITH ADMIN
   OPTION</code> on itself, but it may grant or revoke membership in
   itself from a database session where the session user matches the
   role.  Database superusers can grant or revoke membership in any role
   to anyone.  Roles having <code class="literal">CREATEROLE</code> privilege can grant
   or revoke membership in any role that is not a superuser.
  </p><p>
   Unlike the case with privileges, membership in a role cannot be granted
   to <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code>.  Note also that this form of the command does not
   allow the noise word <code class="literal">GROUP</code>.
  </p></div></div><div class="refsect1" id="SQL-GRANT-NOTES"><h2>Notes</h2><p>
    The <a class="xref" href="sql-revoke.html" title="REVOKE"><span class="refentrytitle">REVOKE</span></a> command is used
    to revoke access privileges.
   </p><p>
    Since <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> 8.1, the concepts of users and
    groups have been unified into a single kind of entity called a role.
    It is therefore no longer necessary to use the keyword <code class="literal">GROUP</code>
    to identify whether a grantee is a user or a group.  <code class="literal">GROUP</code>
    is still allowed in the command, but it is a noise word.
   </p><p>
    A user may perform <code class="command">SELECT</code>, <code class="command">INSERT</code>, etc. on a
    column if they hold that privilege for either the specific column or
    its whole table.  Granting the privilege at the table level and then
    revoking it for one column will not do what one might wish: the
    table-level grant is unaffected by a column-level operation.
   </p><p>
    When a non-owner of an object attempts to <code class="command">GRANT</code> privileges
    on the object, the command will fail outright if the user has no
    privileges whatsoever on the object.  As long as some privilege is
    available, the command will proceed, but it will grant only those
    privileges for which the user has grant options.  The <code class="command">GRANT ALL
    PRIVILEGES</code> forms will issue a warning message if no grant options are
    held, while the other forms will issue a warning if grant options for
    any of the privileges specifically named in the command are not held.
    (In principle these statements apply to the object owner as well, but
    since the owner is always treated as holding all grant options, the
    cases can never occur.)
   </p><p>
    It should be noted that database superusers can access
    all objects regardless of object privilege settings.  This
    is comparable to the rights of <code class="literal">root</code> in a Unix system.
    As with <code class="literal">root</code>, it's unwise to operate as a superuser
    except when absolutely necessary.
   </p><p>
    If a superuser chooses to issue a <code class="command">GRANT</code> or <code class="command">REVOKE</code>
    command, the command is performed as though it were issued by the
    owner of the affected object.  In particular, privileges granted via
    such a command will appear to have been granted by the object owner.
    (For role membership, the membership appears to have been granted
    by the containing role itself.)
   </p><p>
    <code class="command">GRANT</code> and <code class="command">REVOKE</code> can also be done by a role
    that is not the owner of the affected object, but is a member of the role
    that owns the object, or is a member of a role that holds privileges
    <code class="literal">WITH GRANT OPTION</code> on the object.  In this case the
    privileges will be recorded as having been granted by the role that
    actually owns the object or holds the privileges
    <code class="literal">WITH GRANT OPTION</code>.  For example, if table
    <code class="literal">t1</code> is owned by role <code class="literal">g1</code>, of which role
    <code class="literal">u1</code> is a member, then <code class="literal">u1</code> can grant privileges
    on <code class="literal">t1</code> to <code class="literal">u2</code>, but those privileges will appear
    to have been granted directly by <code class="literal">g1</code>.  Any other member
    of role <code class="literal">g1</code> could revoke them later.
   </p><p>
    If the role executing <code class="command">GRANT</code> holds the required privileges
    indirectly via more than one role membership path, it is unspecified
    which containing role will be recorded as having done the grant.  In such
    cases it is best practice to use <code class="command">SET ROLE</code> to become the
    specific role you want to do the <code class="command">GRANT</code> as.
   </p><p>
    Granting permission on a table does not automatically extend
    permissions to any sequences used by the table, including
    sequences tied to <code class="type">SERIAL</code> columns.  Permissions on
    sequences must be set separately.
   </p><p>
    Use <a class="xref" href="app-psql.html" title="psql"><span class="refentrytitle"><span class="application">psql</span></span></a>'s <code class="command">\dp</code> command
    to obtain information about existing privileges for tables and
    columns.  For example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
=&gt; \dp mytable
                              Access privileges
 Schema |  Name   | Type  |   Access privileges   | Column access privileges 
--------+---------+-------+-----------------------+--------------------------
 public | mytable | table | miriam=arwdDxt/miriam | col1:
                          : =r/miriam             :   miriam_rw=rw/miriam
                          : admin=arw/miriam        
(1 row)
</pre><p>
    The entries shown by <code class="command">\dp</code> are interpreted thus:
</p><pre class="literallayout">
rolename=xxxx -- privileges granted to a role
        =xxxx -- privileges granted to PUBLIC

            r -- SELECT ("read")
            w -- UPDATE ("write")
            a -- INSERT ("append")
            d -- DELETE
            D -- TRUNCATE
            x -- REFERENCES
            t -- TRIGGER
            X -- EXECUTE
            U -- USAGE
            C -- CREATE
            c -- CONNECT
            T -- TEMPORARY
      arwdDxt -- ALL PRIVILEGES (for tables, varies for other objects)
            * -- grant option for preceding privilege

        /yyyy -- role that granted this privilege
</pre><p>

    The above example display would be seen by user <code class="literal">miriam</code> after
    creating table <code class="literal">mytable</code> and doing:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
GRANT SELECT ON mytable TO PUBLIC;
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT ON mytable TO admin;
GRANT SELECT (col1), UPDATE (col1) ON mytable TO miriam_rw;
</pre><p>
   </p><p>
    For non-table objects there are other <code class="command">\d</code> commands
    that can display their privileges.
   </p><p>
    If the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Access privileges</span>”</span> column is empty for a given object,
    it means the object has default privileges (that is, its privileges column
    is null).  Default privileges always include all privileges for the owner,
    and can include some privileges for <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code> depending on the
    object type, as explained above.  The first <code class="command">GRANT</code> or
    <code class="command">REVOKE</code> on an object
    will instantiate the default privileges (producing, for example,
    <code class="literal">{miriam=arwdDxt/miriam}</code>) and then modify them per the
    specified request.  Similarly, entries are shown in <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Column access
    privileges</span>”</span> only for columns with nondefault privileges.
    (Note: for this purpose, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">default privileges</span>”</span> always means the
    built-in default privileges for the object's type.  An object whose
    privileges have been affected by an <code class="command">ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES</code>
    command will always be shown with an explicit privilege entry that
    includes the effects of the <code class="command">ALTER</code>.)
   </p><p>
    Notice that the owner's implicit grant options are not marked in the
    access privileges display.  A <code class="literal">*</code> will appear only when
    grant options have been explicitly granted to someone.
   </p></div><div class="refsect1" id="SQL-GRANT-EXAMPLES"><h2>Examples</h2><p>
   Grant insert privilege to all users on table <code class="literal">films</code>:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
GRANT INSERT ON films TO PUBLIC;
</pre><p>
  </p><p>
   Grant all available privileges to user <code class="literal">manuel</code> on view
   <code class="literal">kinds</code>:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON kinds TO manuel;
</pre><p>

   Note that while the above will indeed grant all privileges if executed by a
   superuser or the owner of <code class="literal">kinds</code>, when executed by someone
   else it will only grant those permissions for which the someone else has
   grant options.
  </p><p>
   Grant membership in role <code class="literal">admins</code> to user <code class="literal">joe</code>:

</p><pre class="programlisting">
GRANT admins TO joe;
</pre></div><div class="refsect1" id="SQL-GRANT-COMPATIBILITY"><h2>Compatibility</h2><p>
    According to the SQL standard, the <code class="literal">PRIVILEGES</code>
    key word in <code class="literal">ALL PRIVILEGES</code> is required.  The
    SQL standard does not support setting the privileges on more than
    one object per command.
   </p><p>
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> allows an object owner to revoke their
    own ordinary privileges: for example, a table owner can make the table
    read-only to themselves by revoking their own <code class="literal">INSERT</code>,
    <code class="literal">UPDATE</code>, <code class="literal">DELETE</code>, and <code class="literal">TRUNCATE</code>
    privileges.  This is not possible according to the SQL standard.  The
    reason is that <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> treats the owner's
    privileges as having been granted by the owner to themselves; therefore they
    can revoke them too.  In the SQL standard, the owner's privileges are
    granted by an assumed entity <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">_SYSTEM</span>”</span>.  Not being
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">_SYSTEM</span>”</span>, the owner cannot revoke these rights.
   </p><p>
    According to the SQL standard, grant options can be granted to
    <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code>; PostgreSQL only supports granting grant options
    to roles.
   </p><p>
    The SQL standard provides for a <code class="literal">USAGE</code> privilege
    on other kinds of objects: character sets, collations,
    translations.
   </p><p>
    In the SQL standard, sequences only have a <code class="literal">USAGE</code>
    privilege, which controls the use of the <code class="literal">NEXT VALUE FOR</code>
    expression, which is equivalent to the
    function <code class="function">nextval</code> in PostgreSQL.  The sequence
    privileges <code class="literal">SELECT</code> and <code class="literal">UPDATE</code> are
    PostgreSQL extensions.  The application of the
    sequence <code class="literal">USAGE</code> privilege to
    the <code class="literal">currval</code> function is also a PostgreSQL extension (as
    is the function itself).
   </p><p>
    Privileges on databases, tablespaces, schemas, and languages are
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> extensions.
